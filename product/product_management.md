# What is a Product Manager?
At Postlight, product managers sit at the intersection of business, technology, and design. They help their companies build software that solve problems for their users.

Product managers help their teams collectively feel ownership over what they are building and ensure everyone has a voice. They collect feedback and make tough decisions when necessary. They are applauded when things go well and held accountable when things go wrong. They are not dictators: They build consensus.

# What is a Product Manager’s Job?
A product manager is responsible for keeping the team’s daily progress aligned with the long term product vision.

As a product manager, you are responsible for helping your team build and ship a product that *solves a problem* for your users. This requires a deep understanding of those users. A product manager should ask questions like: 

- What challenges do my users face? 
- What workarounds have they developed? 
- What existing products or solutions do they use? 
- What don’t they like about those solutions? 
- How can I provide them with something better? 

As a product manager, you are responsible for tracking down the answers to these questions and letting those answers guide your product’s development. Great products aren’t just sets of features. They are defined by the problems they solve, or the interesting situations they create. 

# What Should a Product Manager Do Every Day?
As a product manager, your daily activities will vary with the stage of your product, your current goals, and the size and makeup of your team. 

In the beginning of a product’s life cycle, you’ll spend time gathering, documenting, and presenting information, often working closely with a product designer. This might mean:

- experimenting with existing products in the same space
- conducting market researching
- conducting user interviews
- wireframing and sketching

Once you understand the problem you’re solving, you can start to define a product that makes sense for your business. This might require:

- defining and prototyping an MVP
- creating a product roadmap and budget
- creating a financial model to forecast a product’s viability
- soliciting buy in from key stakeholders

You’ll want to revisit all of the above now and then to reflect new learnings and ensure you’re staying on track.

Once a product is in active development, your time might be spent driving the daily operations of your team. This might mean: 

- identifying and championing a project management process that works for your team
- facilitating collaboration and feedback within the team
- soliciting and responding to external feedback through demos, testing links, updates
- making difficult decisions to keep your budget and roadmap on track
- communicating externally when plans change

As a product or feature approaches launch, you’ll want to think about how to get your product in users’ hands and measure its success. This might mean:

- defining a rollout strategy, implementing beta or A/B tests, and fine-tuning your product for release
- defining KPIs, integrating analytics software, and building data dashboards
- writing copy for marketing materials

Once your product is live, you’ll need to provide support to users, synthesize qualitative and quantitative feedback, and plan for future product enhancements. This might mean:

- implementing a support queue and process for responding to bugs reports and questions
- drawing insights from user data dashboards to guide continued product development

# What Skills Should a Product Manager Have?
At Postlight, we ask our product managers to be proficient in modern technology and design practices. A product manager is *not* meant to be the design or engineering expert on a team. That said, they need to provide feedback on both the design and the implementation of the product they are building. They should feel comfortable estimating the time it takes to build a feature, articulating why a certain UI isn’t right, and everything in between.

Product managers should be exceptionally strong communicators. They serve as the the face of their products to various stakeholders, both internal and external. Product managers help facilitate communication between otherwise disconnected groups, so distilling and relaying information must come naturally.

Beyond facilitating and communicating, an exceptional product manager represents the product with passion and conviction. In a sense they represent the product just as an entrepreneur would represent a startup. They defend the strategy and direction of the effort. 

On smaller teams, product managers sometimes contribute as developers or designers on their teams as well. As a product manager, your workload will vary with the stage of your product, the type of product you’re building, and the size and capability of your team. Being able to contribute to design or development can help keep a product manager engaged when a product doesn’t require full time management.
